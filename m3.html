          <h2>About Kangchenjunga</h2>
          <p>
            Kangchenjunga, also spelled Kanchenjunga, is the highest mountain in the Himalayas, 
            standing at a towering 8,586 meters (28,169 feet) above sea level. Located on the border of Nepal and India, 
            Kangchenjunga is the third highest mountain in the world, after Mount Everest and K2. It is a popular 
            destination for mountain climbers and trekkers, known for its stunning views and challenging terrain.


          </p>
          <p>
            The mountain is considered sacred by the local people and its name, which translates 
            to "Five Treasures of Snows," refers to the five peaks that make up the mountain. 
            Kangchenjunga is an iconic symbol of the Himalayas and a testament to the strength and 
            resilience of the human spirit. Despite its difficult and dangerous ascent, the mountain has 
            been successfully climbed by many brave and skilled climbers over the years. The sense of accomplishment 
            and the breathtaking views from the summit make the journey to the top of Kangchenjunga a truly unforgettable 
            experience.

                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  The climate at Kangchenjunga can vary significantly depending on the altitude
                   and the time of year. At lower elevations, the climate is typically cold and dry,
                    with temperatures ranging from -5 to 5 degrees Celsius (23 to 41 degrees Fahrenheit). 
                    At higher elevations, the climate is much colder, with temperatures frequently dropping 
                    below freezing. The mountain is also prone to strong winds and storms, which can make 
                    conditions even more challenging for climbers.

                  There are several routes that have been established for climbing Kangchenjunga. 
                  The most common route is the Northeast Ridge, which is the route that was used 
                  for the first successful ascent of the mountain in 1955. 
                  This route starts from the Yalung Glacier in Nepal and follows the Northeast Ridge to the summit.

          <h2>Early Attempts</h2>
          <p>
            There have been many attempts to climb Kangchenjunga over the years, with the first recorded attempt dating back to 1849. 
            It was not until 1955 that a successful ascent was finally made, when a British expedition team led by Charles Evans 
            reached the summit. The team's successful climb marked a major milestone in the history of mountain climbing and cemented 
            Kangchenjunga's reputation as a challenging and formidable mountain.

          <h2>First Successful Summit</h2>
          <p>
            The first successful summit of Kangchenjunga was made by a British expedition team in 1955. 
            The team was led by Charles Evans and included Joe Brown, George Band, and Neil Mather. 
            The team reached the summit on May 25, 1955, after a challenging and dangerous climb up the mountain's 
            steep and icy slopes. Prior to their successful ascent, several other attempts had been made to reach the 
            top of Kangchenjunga, but all had been unsuccessful. The successful climb by the British team marked a major milestone in 
            the history of mountain climbing and cemented Kangchenjunga's reputation as a challenging and formidable mountain.

          <h2>Tourism</h2>
          <p>
            Because of its remote location in Nepal and the difficulty involved in accessing it from India, 
            the Kangchenjunga region is not much explored by trekkers. It has, therefore, retained much of its pristine beauty. 
            In Sikkim too, trekking into the Kangchenjunga region has just recently been permitted. 
            The Goecha La trek is gaining popularity amongst tourists. It goes to the Goecha La Pass, 
            located right in front of the huge southeast face of Kangchenjunga. 
            Another trek to Green Lake Basin has recently been opened for trekking. 
            This trek goes to the Northeast side of Kangchenjunga along the famous Zemu Glacier. 
            The film Singalila in the Himalaya is journey around Kangchenjunga.
