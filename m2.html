          <h2>About K2</h2>
          <p>
            K2, also known as Chhogori in Pakistan and Qogir in China, is the
            second highest mountain in the world, reaching a height of 28,251
            feet (8,611 meters). It is located in the Karakoram mountain range,
            on the border of Pakistan and China. Like Mount Everest, K2 is a
            popular destination for mountaineers and adventurers, and is known
            for its challenging and dangerous climbing conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first attempt to summit K2 took place in 1902, but it was not
            until 1954 that the mountain was successfully climbed. Since then,
            numerous expeditions have attempted to reach the summit, but K2
            remains one of the most difficult and deadliest mountains in the
            world. Each year, a small number of climbers are able to reach the
            top, but many have lost their lives trying. Despite its challenges,
            K2 continues to attract the most skilled and experienced
            mountaineers from around the globe.

          <h2>Early Attempts</h2>
          <p>
            The first recorded attempt to reach the summit of K2 occurred in
            1902, when an Italian expedition led by Duke of the Abruzzi
            attempted to reach the top of the mountain. The team was unable to
            reach the summit, but they were able to make it to a high point on
            the mountain known as the "saddle," which is located at an altitude
            of about 6,500 meters. In the following years, several other
            expeditions attempted to climb K2, but all were unsuccessful.

            It wasn't until 1954 that the mountain was finally successfully
            climbed, when an Italian team led by Ardito Desio reached the
            summit. Since then, numerous expeditions have attempted to climb K2,
            and although a small number of climbers have been successful, many
            have lost their lives trying due to the mountain's challenging and

          <p>
            Since the first successful summit, K2 has remained a popular
            destination for mountain climbers from all over the world. However,
            the mountain has also seen its share of controversy, with debates
            over the impact of tourism on the environment and the safety of
            climbers. In recent years, there have been efforts to regulate the
            number of climbers on the mountain and to improve safety measures,
            including the use of satellite phones and emergency shelters along
            the climbing routes.

          <h2>Deadly</h2>
          <p>
            Despite these efforts, K2 remains one of the most challenging and
            dangerous mountains in the world to climb, with a high fatality rate
            compared to other 8,000 meter peaks. The mountain has claimed the
            lives of many experienced climbers, and each year a small number of
            people lose their lives while attempting to reach the summit.
            Despite these challenges, K2 continues to attract skilled and
            experienced mountaineers from around the globe, drawn by the thrill
            of tackling one of the most difficult and prestigious climbs in the
            world.
